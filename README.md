# Project Name:
Auto Shop Finance

# Description
My project is a flask web application created specifically for my father's small auto repair business.
The app is meant to increase efficiency in the accounting department of the business.

# Features
The features of this project include the following:
- User Authentication: to ensure security and privacy for my father's shop. Each user has their own database
                        corresponding to their customers, and transactions.

- Dashboard: This dashboard include the business' income, expense and net profit for the year.
             It displays an interactive graph of the business' net profit by month.
             Finally, it shows recent income/expense transactions.

- Income tracking: The Income page shows all your income transactions to date and contains a search
                   bar with a dynamic function that allows you to search for any income transaction
                   by date, description or amount (without having to refresh the page). On this page,
                   you are also able to add or delete any transaction which will reflect on the dashboard.

- Expense tracking: The Expense page shows all your expense transactions to date and contains a search
                   bar with a dynamic function that allows you to search for any expense transaction
                   by date, description or amount (without having to refresh the page). On this page,
                   you are also able to add or delete any transaction which will reflect on the dashboard.

- Customer database: The customer database page shows you all the customers that you have added to your
                     system with the "Add customer" button. Like the Income and Expense page, you can
                     delete any customer, and search for any customer based on name, number, email or
                     address (without having to refresh the page).

- Receipt Generation: Lastly, and probably the most useful feature, is the receipt generation page. After
                      inputing just a few pieces of data like the customer's information, you can add the
                      cost of parts, labour, other and optionally your discount. Then, just press "Generate
                      Receipt" and a professional receipt is produced on a separate page for you to download
                      and send to your customers.

- Logout, Login, Register, Change Password: I also included all these necessary functions to ensure security and privacy.

# Instructions
The instructions for this project are extremely simple. All you have to do is download the final.zip file. Upload it to
your github codespace, unzip it. Then in the terminal, type "cd final", then "flask run". Now, you can click the link
and freely use the auto shop finance application. (Register, add your income, expense, customers, and generate receipts
as you like)

Step 3:
Click on the "Income" button on the header, to be directed to the Income page. Here you can press "Add Income". Another page will appear
where you enter the description of your transaction, the amount, and the date. Then press "Add Income" to confirm.

Step 4:
To delete any income transactions, just click the "Delete: button on the right side of the transaction that you want to delete. Then a message will
appear for you to confirm the deletion. Just press "ok".

Step 5:
To seach for any income transaction. Simply type any letter, phrase, word, or number into the search bar, and the table will only display transactions
related to your search. There is no need to press enter on your keyboard, as the table updates automatically as you type.

Step 6:
Add, delete and search for expenses in exactly the same way as you did for the Income Transactions.

Step 7:
Click "Customer Database" at the header. When you are directed to your customer database (specific to the user), you can add customers by clicking
"Add Customer" and entering their name, number, email and address. You will then see this reflected in your database. You can delete customers as you
wish, as well as search for them based on name, number, email or address.

Step 8:
Click on "Generate Receipt" at the top. When you are directed to the page, you can enter information to generate receipt. Enter the customer's details
such as their name, number, car type, license plate, mileage etc. You can then add items to the receipt as categorized by parts, labour or other.
Just enter a description and cost for each item and feel free to add or delete as many items as you like. Then, enter the percentage of the discount you
would like to give your customer, but don't worry (it's optional). Finally press "Generate Receipt" and a receipt will be generated specifically for my
father's auto repair shop. The receipt looks neat and professional and even shows you the value in cash of the discount you gave. To download, just click
on the print icon on the top right corner and click "Save".

Step 9:
Over the months, return to the dashboard to see your net income for the year (specifically for the current year). Interact with the graph to see your net
income by month. View your last 10 recent transactions on the right hand side, and enjoy the picture of a Mitsubish Evolution as inspiration for making more
profit.
